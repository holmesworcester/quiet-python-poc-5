# Identity as Core Feature - Implementation Summary

## What We Implemented

### 1. Core Identity Module (`core/identity.py`)
- `Identity` class with signing capabilities
- `create_identity()` - Creates and stores identity in core_identities table
- `get_identity()` - Retrieves identity by ID
- `sign_with_identity()` - Signs data using identity's public key (for dependency-based signing)

### 2. Signature Handler Updates
- Uses resolved dependencies when available (for peer-based signing)
- Falls back to direct identity signing for events without peers
- Handles both self-created and received events uniformly

### 3. Database Changes
- Added `core_identities` table for core framework
- Updated queries to use `core_identities` instead of old `identities` table
- Removed identity event creation from protocol

### 4. Event Updates
- Messages use `peer_id` field (currently set to identity_id as temporary solution)
- Network events signed directly with identity (no peer yet)
- Removed identity dependencies from events

## Current Architecture

```
Core Framework:
- Manages identities (private keys, signing)
- Provides identity CRUD operations
- Handles signature creation

Protocol Layer:
- Defines event types and relationships
- Peer events represent network presence (TODO: fully implement)
- All events reference peers (or identities temporarily)
```

## Test Status
âœ… Multi-identity chat test passing
- Two identities can create separate networks
- Messages are properly isolated between networks
- Signing and validation working correctly

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Peer Event Creation**
   - Network creation should create peer events
   - Need way to lookup peer event ID for an identity

2. **Message peer_id**
   - Currently using identity_id as peer_id
   - Should be actual peer event ID

3. **Dependency-based Signing**
   - Partially implemented (signature handler supports it)
   - Need peer events to fully utilize

## Key Insights

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Core identity = authentication (who can sign)
   - Peer events = authorization (who is on network)

2. **Dependency Resolution for Signing**
   - Can use same dependency system for both signing and verification
   - Makes handlers pure (no DB access needed)

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   - When ideal architecture isn't ready, use pragmatic fallbacks
   - Identity_id as peer_id works temporarily

## Next Steps

1. Implement peer event creation consistently
2. Add peer event lookup by identity
3. Update messages to use actual peer event IDs
4. Remove temporary fallbacks once peer system is complete
